Simple Shell in C
This project aims to create a basic shell program in the C programming
language. The objective is not just to develop a functional shell
but also to delve into the fundamentals of programming,
C language, engineering mindset, and teamwork.

Project Overview
The simple shell program provides a command-line interface where a user
can interact with the operating system by executing commands.
Throughout the development process, we aim to cover
the following aspects:

--Learning Objectives--

Basics of Programming: Understanding fundamental programming
concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and control structures
within the context of building a shell.

Basics of C: Exploring the C programming language's syntax, data types,
memory management, pointers, and libraries necessary to implement
a shell.

Engineering Mindset: Emphasizing problem-solving, algorithmic thinking,
and efficient code design to create a functional shell that handles
various commands and scenarios.

Group Working and Managing: Collaborating within a team, managing tasks,
coordinating efforts, and utilizing version control (e.g., Git, GitHub)
for effective project management.

--Features--
Command Execution: Ability to execute various system commands
(e.g., ls, cd, mkdir) from the shell.

Input Parsing: Parsing user input to identify commands and arguments.

Error Handling: Implementing error handling for invalid commands
or incorrect usage.

Basic Shell Functionalities: Supporting functionalities like
redirection, piping, and background processes
(if applicable within scope)
